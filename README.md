  <em>One model for fine-grained motion, long-video reasoning, temporal grounding, and online proactive response.</em>

## ✨ Overview

**VideoChat3** is a 4B generalist video MLLM built to understand video across time—from subtle motion and hour-long stories to precise temporal evidence and live streams.

It combines **I3D-ViT** for 16× spatiotemporal compression with **Adaptive Frame Resolution** for evidence-aware streaming, trained on **Academic2M**, **LV116K**, and **OL617K**.

## :fire: Updates
- [x] **2026/08/25**: 🔥🔥🔥Update the arXiv paper and evaluation code.
- [x] **2026/07/27**: 🔥🔥🔥Release the full-stage training data and training checkpoints for each stage of VideoChat3.
- [x] **2026/07/27**: 🔥🔥🔥Release the training code for VideoChat3.
- [x] **2026/07/24**: 🔥🔥🔥Release the evaluation code for VideoChat3.
- [x] **2026/07/17**: 🔥🔥🔥Release the VideoChat3 model weights and training data.


## 🚀 Highlights

- 🎬 **Generalist video understanding:** one model for motion, long video, temporal grounding, and online proactive response.
- ⚡ **Token-efficient architecture:** I3D-ViT compresses redundant visual tokens while preserving spatiotemporal evidence.
- 🔍 **Adaptive streaming perception:** frame resolution is increased only when closer visual inspection is needed.
- 🔓 **Open resources:** model weights and the complete training datasets are publicly available.

## 🛠️ Training

The training implementation is available in
[`xtuner-videochat3`](xtuner-videochat3). It is built on [XTuner V1](https://github.com/internLM/xtuner) and includes
the VideoChat3 model and data pipeline, staged training configurations, initial
checkpoint construction, and Slurm/non-Slurm distributed launchers.

Install the training project:

```bash
cd xtuner-videochat3
pip install -e ".[video]"
```

After preparing the model and dataset paths in the selected configuration, start
a launcher from the same directory. For example, a single-node stage1-1 run is:

```bash
NNODES=1 NPROC_PER_NODE=8 \
  bash training_scripts/stage1/VideoChat3_4B_train_stage1-1.sh
```

See the [complete training guide](xtuner-videochat3/README.md) for initial
checkpoint construction, all stage configurations, Slurm launch commands, and
manual multi-node setup.

## 🏆 Evaluation

The evaluation implementation is available in [`vlmevalkit-videochat3`](vlmevalkit-videochat3). It is built on
[VLMEvalKit](https://github.com/open-compass/VLMEvalKit) and supports all
benchmarks for both offline and online video understanding evaluated in the
paper.

Please refer to the [evaluation guide](vlmevalkit-videochat3/Eval/README.md) for detailed instructions
on environment setup, model downloading, and evaluation.

## 🌟 Quick Start

Please follow the instructions in [VideoChat3-4B](https://huggingface.co/MCG-NJU/VideoChat3-4B) to set up the environment and download the model weights. 

```
pip install torch transformers accelerate qwen-vl-utils
pip install decord opencv-python-headless
# optional
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

We provide two inference implementations [here](demo)—one for standard model inference and the other for online proactive-response inference—to help you get started quickly.
